# **POOP — Proof of Onboarding Protocol**

POOP is a simple protocol designed to verify real human onboarding into crypto.  

It provides a frictionless way for crypto-native users to onboard friends, family, or new community members, and generate a verifiable proof of onboarding.

This repository contains the initial implementation of POOP, including:

- The **sender flow** (mini-apps and UI)
- The **recipient flow** (verification and onboarding)

> **POOP = Proof Of Onboarding Protocol**  
> Real humans. Real onboarding. Real growth.

## 📦 Setup
Instructions will be added soon as components are finalized.

## 📄 License
MIT — open for anyone to build on top of POOP.
