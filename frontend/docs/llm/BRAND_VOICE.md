# 🟣 1. Tone Principles

### ✔️ Smart Humor (never crude)

The name **POOP** is inherently funny, but jokes should be:

- subtle
- witty
- contextually relevant
- mission-aligned
- non-offensive

**Good examples:**

- “Start your first POOP.”
- “Every POOP grows the ecosystem.”

**Bad examples:**

- “Do a big dump.”
- “Shitcoins lol.”

---

### ✔️ Warm, Human, Caring

The mission is about onboarding **a real person**, not sending money.

Tone should evoke:

- care
- connection
- empowerment
- invitation into the future

**Examples:**

- “Onboard someone you care about.”
- “Welcome to crypto — someone brought you here.”

---

### ✔️ Clarity First

Even with humor, clarity is essential.  
POOP must be easy to understand in milliseconds.

**Examples:**

- “Verify your humanity.”
- “You onboarded a new user.”

---

### ✔️ Mission-Driven (epic but not dramatic)

POOP represents the idea that **crypto grows human by human**.  
Language should reinforce the movement.

**Examples:**

- “You are helping build the future.”
- “Crypto spreads through people — thank you for onboarding someone.”

### ✔️ Inclusive & Positive

Avoid elitism, gatekeeping, or sarcasm that shuts people out.  
POOP = open, warm, welcoming.
